=head1 NAME

WriteOnceHash - be a Hash in which each key can only be set once

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use WriteOnceHash;

# bind to predefined class
my %woh is WriteOnceHash;
%woh<a> = 5; # ok
%woh<a> = 1; # throws

CATCH {
    when X::Hash::WriteOnce {
        say "Sorry, already set {.key} before";
        .resume
    }
}

# mix in role on anything that does Associative
my %owoh{Any} does WriteOnce;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module makes an C<WriteOnceHash> class available that can be used
instead of the normal C<Hash>.  The only difference with a normal
C<Hash> is, is that if an attempt is made to set the value of a key that
B<has already been set before>, an exception is thrown rather than just
overwriting the key in the C<Hash>.

Also binding to non-existing keys in the hash, and then assigning to the
obtained container, will only work once.  Iterating over values of the
hash will only yield values, not containers (as a normal C<Hash> would).

Also exports a C<X::Hash::WriteOnce> error class that will be thrown
if an attempt is made to set a key again.

The underlying C<WriteOnce> role is also exported that can be used on
objects that perform the C<Associative> role that are not C<Hash> (such
as object hashes).
