0.0.3  2018-10-02T14:59:07+02:00
    - Simplify: since we're already storing values de-containerized, and
      we also override ASSIGN-KEY, we don't actually need to override
      AT-KEY at all.  Should one bind to the output of AT-KEY and then
      try to assign, that will die anyway because of being an immutable
      value.  This removes the need for the proxy and should remove any
      performance penalty from just accessing keys in the hash.

0.0.2  2018-10-02T14:44:07+02:00
    - Also disallow removal of keys

0.0.1  2018-10-02T14:24:24+02:00
    - Initial version
